# views

## arrangement
mimimized views can be **moved** and **rearranged** by simple **drag and drop**.

## python console
python console can be invoked with M-x -> python console

## run
vim and emacs work in the **run** view, but not perfectly. C-z works fine, though

## best practice
debug on the left(dock pinned)
run on the left(undock)
terminal, python console, and version control on the right

## view mode
- dock pinned(affect the size of the editor; mimimize when clicking the editor)
- dock unpinned(affect the size of the editor; not mimimize when clicking the editor)
- undock(doesn't affect the size of the editor; mimimize when clicking the editor)
- float
- window

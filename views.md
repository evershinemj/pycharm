# views

## arrangement
mimimized views can be **moved** and **rearranged** by simple **drag and drop**.

## python console
python console can be invoked with M-x -> python console

## run
- vim and emacs work in the **run** view, but not perfectly. C-z works fine, though
- two basic situations: 
  1. run current file(top right button, or right click -> run <current-file>) 
  2. choose a file to run(M-x -> run...)
- **right click on the current file to run** approach is preferred, as top right button can only run files that have already been run

## best practice
debug on the left(dock pinned)
run on the left(undock)
terminal, python console, and version control on the right

## view mode
- dock pinned(affect the size of the editor; mimimize when clicking the editor)
- dock unpinned(affect the size of the editor; not mimimize when clicking the editor)
- undock(doesn't affect the size of the editor; mimimize when clicking the editor)
- float
- window
